This repository has been created to host the Defrag iPad app repository.  This project is a private project that is intended to launch in the appStore and all ownership of the code and content belongs to David Olson (david-speakeasy@mindspring.com).

That being said, I am the developer Steve Warren (steve@interactivenyc.com), and a close personal friend of David Olson.  At the early stage of this development, I will be committing development code into GitHub to see how it works in practice.  I may decide with Dave that we will take this project all the way to completion publicly on GitHub, and allow other iPad magazine developers to use our codebase to create their own magazines.  This is TBD.

I invite anyone who is interested to check out my code, ask questions, and contribute.  This is my first IOS project, but I have 20 years of software development experience, mostly in Flash, Director and HyperCard.  

Thanks for reading this.

Steve Warren
